      		That’s why JINYA Ramen Bar’s signature stocks take center-stage on our menu. Slowly simmered for more than ten hours, we combine whole pork bones, chickens or vegetables with just the right amount of bonito, dashi, kombu and other authentic ingredients. The result is a rich broth that is thick, full-flavored, healthful… and unforgettable.
			However, we believe that there’s still more to ramen than broth. We take our noodles seriously, too. Meticulously aged for three days to maximize their flavor, JINYA Ramen Bar’s noodles are made fresh daily and crafted to sink perfectly in your bowl with thick noodles for some broths and thin noodles for others.

     		 The first food critic to ever win a Pulitzer Prize wrote about his experience when he visited JINYA Ramen on Ventura Boulevard, Studio City, California: 
			
			But then the ramen comes: big, earthen bowls of the house ramen made with strong chicken stock and garnished with seed-studded chicken meatballs; of the greenery-rich vegetable ramen made with the same stock; and of the tonkotsu ramen, made from long-boiled pork bones and fortified with generous spoonfuls of pork oil, which transform the dish into a flavor bomb.

     		  Imagine a world where eating ramen is an everyday ritual, like ordering pizza or going out for a great burger. This is the daily reality that JINYA Ramen Bar founder Tomonori Takahashi came from when he arrived in the United States in 2010. But when he searched for his favorite Japanese food, he quickly realized that enjoying the traditional taste and flavor of ramen wasn’t possible – unless he made it himself.
			 
			 The son of a successful restauranteur in Japan, Tomonori knew what it would take to build a great restaurant. His father had owned an Isakaya-style restaurant named Jinya, where he focused on three values: Delicious food at reasonable prices that’s accessible to all.
			 
			 Wanting to revive his father’s dream, Tomonori opened his first JINYA in Tokyo in 2000. Named for a Samurai soldier that was close to the community and owned a small property, JINYA was an appropriate name that embodied the ideals of Tomonori’s new restaurant. When he saw the need for authentic ramen in the United States, he decided to set up shop in California and continue his family’s legacy. JINYA Ramen Bar was born.
